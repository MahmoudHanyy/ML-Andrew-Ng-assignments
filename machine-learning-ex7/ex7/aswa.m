%  Instructions
%  ------------
%
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
%
%     pca.m
%     projectData.m
%     recoverData.m
%     computeCentroids.m
%     findClosestCentroids.m
%     kMeansInitCentroids.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% ================= Part 1: Find Closest Centroids ====================
%  To help you implement K-Means, we have divided the learning algorithm 
%  into two functions -- findClosestCentroids and computeCentroids. In this
%  part, you should complete the code in the findClosestCentroids function. 
%
fprintf('Finding closest centroids.\n\n');

% Load an example dataset that we will be using
load('ex7data2.mat');

% Select an initial set of centroids
K = 3; % 3 Centroids
initial_centroids = [3 3; 6 2; 8 5];

% Find the closest centroids for the examples using the
% initial_centroids
idx = findClosestCentroids(X, initial_centroids);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%% ===================== Part 2: Compute Means =========================
%  After implementing the closest centroids function, you should now
%  complete the computeCentroids function.
%
fprintf('\nComputing centroids means.\n\n');

%  Compute means based on the closest centroids found in the previous part.
centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K);
