%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 4 Neural Network Learning

%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
%  in this exericse:
%
%     sigmoidGradient.m
%     randInitializeWeights.m
%     nnCostFunction.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
%

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

%% Setup the parameters you will use for this exercise
input_layer_size  = 400;  % 20x20 Input Images of Digits
hidden_layer_size = 25;   % 25 hidden units
num_labels = 10;          % 10 labels, from 1 to 10   
                          % (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

%% =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
%  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
%  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
%

% Load Training Data
fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

load('ex4data1.mat');
m = size(X, 1);

% Randomly select 100 data points to display
sel = randperm(size(X, 1));
sel = sel(1:100);


fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% ================ Part 2: Loading Parameters ================
% In this part of the exercise, we load some pre-initialized 
% neural network parameters.

fprintf('\nLoading Saved Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

% Load the weights into variables Theta1 and Theta2
load('ex4weights.mat');

% Unroll parameters 
nn_params = [Theta1(:) ; Theta2(:)];

%% ================ Part 3: Compute Cost (Feedforward) ================
%  To the neural network, you should first start by implementing the
%  feedforward part of the neural network that returns the cost only. You
%  should complete the code in nnCostFunction.m to return cost. After
%  implementing the feedforward to compute the cost, you can verify that
%  your implementation is correct by verifying that you get the same cost
%  as us for the fixed debugging parameters.
%
%  We suggest implementing the feedforward cost *without* regularization
%  first so that it will be easier for you to debug. Later, in part 4, you
%  will get to implement the regularized cost.
%
fprintf('\nFeedforward Using Neural Network ...\n')

% Weight regularization parameter (we set this to 0 here).
lambda = 0;

J = nnCostFunction(nn_params, input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size, ...
                   num_labels, X, y, lambda);
